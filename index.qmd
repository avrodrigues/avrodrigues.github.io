## Hello!

I’m Arthur Rodrigues, an Ecologist Researcher interested in understanding factors and processes that drive and maintain biodiversity patterns, from local to broad scales. Because of that, I have interests in the fields of community ecology, functional ecology, evolutionary macroecology, and biogeography.

Some of my research interest includes:

   - How evolutionary history and biogeography influence current biodiversity patterns;
   - Ecological strategy of species (functional traits) and its relationship with community assembly;
   - How anthropogenic factors, such as climate change and land-use, affects biodiversity patterns and community structure;
   - Species distribution modeling;
   - Predicting future scenarios for biodiversity.

Beside that, I have great interest in programming using R language. I have used R for several ends, such as data analysis, creating web pages (like this one), web apps using {shiny}, maps and data visualization using {ggplot2}, as well as creating R packages, for example the {naturaList} package.

Currently I am a Postoctoral Researcher at the [Reseach Centre for Ecological Change](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/research-centre-for-ecological-change), University of Helsiki.
