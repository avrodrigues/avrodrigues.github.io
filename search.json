    "text": "Hello!\nI’m Arthur Rodrigues, an Ecologist Researcher interested in understanding factors and processes that drive and maintain biodiversity patterns, from local to broad scales. Because of that, I have interests in the fields of community ecology, functional ecology, evolutionary macroecology, and biogeography.\nSome of my research interest includes:\n\nHow evolutionary history and biogeography influence current biodiversity patterns;\nEcological strategy of species (functional traits) and its relationship with community assembly;\nHow anthropogenic factors, such as climate change and land-use, affects biodiversity patterns and community structure;\nSpecies distribution modeling;\nPredicting future scenarios for biodiversity.\n\nBeside that, I have great interest in programming using R language. I have used R for several ends, such as data analysis, creating web pages (like this one), web apps using {shiny}, maps and data visualization using {ggplot2}, as well as creating R packages, for example the {naturaList} package.\nCurrently I am a Postoctoral Researcher at the Reseach Centre for Ecological Change, University of Helsiki.\nContact: rodrigues.arthur.v[at]gmail.com"

To conduct the classification, the user should have an occurrence dataset downloaded from GBIF, and a list of expert taxonomist in the taxon of interest. The app provides full guideline to conduct the classification and filtering.\nBased on this work, an R package was developed to provide more flexibility on the classification and cleaning of datasets in R. The {naturaList} package is available from CRAN. You can get started here."

For that, I collected more that 500 plant individuals, and measure several traits. Some of them were derived from images took from branches and leaves.\nIn the app you can view images of the branches, from panoramic view, which enables to contrast area used for wood, bark and pith; and a zoomed view, you can see the vessels and other wood elementes in more details. In addition, you can see stomata in the upper side of the leaf from several species.\nYou can access the paper and the dataset, which include the images showed in the app, in this link."
